# emergency-compliment

This is a neat web app that gives you encouragement, especially the challenging task of learning about Node.js and Express from scratch! If you stick to it with getting this running, you'll get the reward of the praise you deserve, on a background of epic space cats. Pure goodness.

This was originally developed by and for [NodeTogether](https://github.com/NodeTogether/emergency-compliment), and is a great starting point to get to understand how simply a web app can be built with Node.js and Express.

## Install

There are couple ways of installing this. You can set this up on your own computer, or on the web with something like [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/).

First, make this repo yours by forking it. This first step is optional but recommended. It makes it possible for you to freely hack on it.

### Local Install

If you need to get set up with a development environment for Node.js on your computer, work through [this tutorial in the Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/development_environment).

If this all sounds like moon language, then take a look at the very handy [Node Girls cheatsheets](https://github.com/node-girls/cheatsheets).

1. Clone this repository using `git clone`.
1. Move into the repo directory using `cd emergency-compliment`.
1. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
1. Start the server using `npm start`.
1. Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

### Web Install

There's a neat website called [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) where you can write a Node.js application right in your browser, and with the click of a button get a live version of your web app that you can share with anyone.

1. Create an account on [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) using your Github account.
1. Click `Start a New Project`, and then `Start a Node App`.
1. Click on your project name in the top-left corner, then click on `Advanced Options`, and then click "Grant access" where it says "Grant access to import and export to a repo". This will appear above some grayed-out buttons that say `Import from Github` and `Export to Github`.
1. Clicking the `Grant Access` link will take you to an authorization page on Github, telling you what information about your Github profile it will let glitch.com access. This is just enough for glitch.com to be able to Import and Export projects, at your express permission.
1. When you're back in your basic project on Glitch, again click on your project name in the top-left corner, then click on `Advanced Options`, and then `Import from Github`.
1. Glitch will ask for the Github username (yours) and repo name that you want to import from. If your Github username is `tothebeat`, then on this Glitch prompt you should enter `tothebeat/emergency-compliment`.
1. With this code now in the Glitch editor, click on the `Show` / `Live` button at the top to get a new tab with your live site.
